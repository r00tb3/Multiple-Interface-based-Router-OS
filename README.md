# Multiple-Interface-based-Router-OS
A router OS based on Openwrt capable of handling multiple interface's through WAN &amp; USB.

In this OS we have implemented mwan3 to enable auto switch between interfaces which is helpful in banks, shopping malls where the billing/account's systems constantly need internet access using two different interfaces we can continuously keep the connection alive.
